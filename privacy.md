This app is peer-to-peer. It does not depend on any web server or tech support personnel to function.

It doesn't collect any data whatsoever. Your data never leaves your device.

It works everywhere as long as there is internet.

Your funds are securely stored on the phone itself, not anywhere else. Should you loose it somehow there is no one to help you with that. 

It’s your responsibility to backup your Secret Key and keep it private. Never show it to anyone. If it’s lost, forgotten or stollen your funds can be used by the person who has your Secret key.

Do not jailbreak your phone, do not install apps from unknown (untrusted) sources, do not give your device to untrusted people, and keep the Operating System on your phone up to date. The security of your wallet depends on this.

We built the most secure and decentralized wallet we could, however there are no guarantees that there are no unintended software issues. Use it at your own risk. We can fix the bug only after we discover it. 

The entire code powering this app been open to the public scrutiny since the beginning. It's published here, [https://github.com/horizontalsystems](https://github.com/horizontalsystems)
