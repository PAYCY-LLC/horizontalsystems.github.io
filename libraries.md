As we integrate various blockchain protocols into our apps we also provide community with turnkey blockchain libraries for building trully decentralized applications that entirely run on respective blockchains.

With the help of these libraries developers are able to build decentralized applications considerably faster. These libraries do the hard work behind the scenes.

Checkout, Build, Release.

## 1) Bitcoin SPV Client

Full SPV toolkit implementation for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash blockchains. These libraries enable any developer to build true decentrazlied apps on top of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash blockchains. 

Implemented on:

- Swift (iOS): [github.com/horizontalsystems/bitcoin-kit-ios](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/bitcoin-kit-ios)
- Kotlin (Android): [github.com/horizontalsystems/bitcoin-kit-android](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/bitcoin-kit-android)


## 2) Ethereum Light Client

Light client implementation for Ethereum blockchain. 

Build any kind of decentralized applications on top of Ethereum blockchain without getting your hands dirty dealing with protocol. The light client implementation is work in progress and can be closely followed in respective branhes of the repositories.
