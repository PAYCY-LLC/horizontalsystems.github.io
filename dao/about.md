Horizontal Systems is a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) built on Ethereum blockchain and it works just like this vending machine.

It aims to be governed by its shareholders via digital smart contracts and be driven by capable software engineers in a decentralized, transparent, immutable and incorruptible manner. 

Note that we are not a public DAO yet.
