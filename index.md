We build decentralized apps that don't fail and are designed to work indefinitely. 

These apps are peer-to-peer and don't dependent on any centrally-managed servers or human personnel.

## Engineered To Survive

As there are no servers or databases the apps we built are censorship-resistant and by their own nature designed to remain online indefinitely. 

All sensitive information stored encrypted on a smartphone itself and never leaves it. Entirely under user's control. No other entity but the user keeps his data and everything else.

Every single line of code powering these apps is open for public to review and free to reuse. It's open source [@Github](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/).

If you're a blockchain developer we welcome your to review, improve and reuse the code unconditionally.

It's few years ahead of existing crypto wallets as well as any other traditional banking apps.
