Horizontal Systems builds decentralized apps (aka (Dapps)[http://horizontalsystems.io/assets/images/dapps.png])) that are designed from the very start to remain online and functional indefinitely. 

These apps are: 

- eternal: can not be closed or blocked
- liberal: democratic and censorhsip-resistant 
- private: encrypted and peer-to-peer by design
- open source: fully public [@Github](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/)

It's few years ahead of existing crypto wallets as well as any other traditional banking and finance apps.
